                    POMODORO TIMER - IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
================================================================================

PROJECT: Full-Stack Pomodoro Timer Application with Statistics & Task Management
STATUS: ✅ PRODUCTION READY
BUILD: ✅ SUCCESSFUL (No errors, no warnings)

================================================================================
                              CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED
================================================================================

1. ✅ PROGRESS CALCULATION FIX
   File: src/hooks/useTimer.ts
   Issue: Missing bounds checking and calculation verification
   Fix: Added Math.min() clamping and zero-duration guard
   Impact: Progress bar now accurate 0-100%

2. ✅ HISTORY ARCHIVAL FIX
   File: src/store/statsStore.ts
   Issue: Condition prevented daily stats from being archived
   Fix: Check if stats exist instead of checking date mismatch
   Impact: Daily statistics now properly archived to history

3. ✅ DATE FILTERING FIX
   File: src/store/statsStore.ts (getWeeklyStats & getMonthlyStats)
   Issue: Timezone offset causing incorrect date comparisons
   Fix: Added explicit UTC timezone with 'T00:00:00Z' format
   Impact: Weekly/monthly stats now timezone-independent

4. ✅ STREAK CALCULATION FIX
   File: src/hooks/useStats.ts
   Issue: Algorithm didn't verify consecutive dates
   Fix: Compare dates with proper consecutive day validation
   Impact: Streak now correctly tracks consecutive days with activity

5. ✅ DAILY PROGRESS BOUNDS FIX
   File: src/hooks/useStats.ts
   Issue: Missing lower bound on progress calculations
   Fix: Added Math.max(value, 0) for lower bound
   Impact: Daily progress indicators always 0-100%

6. ✅ ESTIMATED TIME CALCULATION FIX
   File: src/utils/index.ts
   Issue: Missing break time in duration estimates
   Fix: Added short break (5min) and long break (15min) calculations
   Impact: Task estimates now include actual time needed

7. ✅ PROGRESS UTILITY BOUNDS FIX
   File: src/utils/index.ts
   Issue: No bounds checking on utility function
   Fix: Added Math.min/Math.max clamping
   Impact: All utility calculations now safe
