# Pomofocus 🍅

A pomodoro timer that helps you focus and actually get stuff done.

## Why this exists

I kept telling myself "I'll start in 5 minutes" and then 3 hours would disappear. Sound familiar?

The Pomodoro Technique changed that for me. 25 minutes of focused work, then a short break. Simple, but it works.

So I built my own timer — clean, no distractions, just what I needed.

## How it works

1. Pick a task
2. Start the 25-minute timer
3. Focus until it rings
4. Take a 5-minute break
5. After 4 pomodoros, take a longer break (15-30 min)

That's the whole method.

## Features

- **Timer modes** — Focus (25 min), Short Break (5 min), Long Break (15 min)
- **Task tracking** — Add tasks, mark them done, see your progress
- **Statistics** — Daily, weekly, monthly views of your focus time
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — Space to start/pause, R to reset, S to skip
- **Dark mode** — Because sometimes you work late
- **Works offline** — All data stays in your browser
